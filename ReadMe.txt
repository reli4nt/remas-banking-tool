Remas Banking tool (N.B. we need a better name for this)

Created for Remas at the Goodnik Helping Hacks Hackathon 2012

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Target audience:

o People who are considering opening a bank account or becoming a member of a credit union,
most for the first time
o Immigrants from Latin America
o English and Spanish speakers
o People who might have a fear/lack of knowledge/mistrust of financial institutions

Goals of tool:

1) Help users understand what their options are for banking, based on:
o what documents they have to open an account
o whether they have SS#, ITIN, or neither
o how they’re planning to use account (just save, make purchases, write checks, all of above,
not sure)
o where they live – zipcode or address
o what language they’re most comfortable in
o how much money they have to open an account
o how much they can typically maintain in the account.

2) Show them next steps if they want to move forward

3) Expand access to banking tools that can improve users’ financial options in the long term.
Information that tool needs to convey:
o Documents needed to open an account (US"issued ID, foreign passport, consular ID, SS#, ITIN etc)
o Fees for account, if any
o Minimum balance to open an account
o Minimum balance to avoid fees
o Features of different account (debit card, checks etc)
o Where banks are located
o Which banks offer services in chosen language
o Which banks offer money transfer products other than wire transfer
o Next steps to take to open an account
o What to consider when opening an account

Tone:
o Lively, bright
o Authoritative without feeling institutional
o Human! Some warmth.
o Trustworthy
o Familiar

Rules of thumb to consider:
o Clear, no unnecessary language
o Try to keep it visually spare and uncluttered
o Be careful about how we ask for information, can be a sensitive point with some users (esp.
questions about address and documentation status)
